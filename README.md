## BUGS

- (not really a bug) if dark theme is selected and page is refreshed, screen flashes white before loading dark mode again



## TO DO
- finish search feature- match queries with pattern matching (not just exact matches)
- modularise Category button into one component & pass category name as props
- set up mocha and chai tests
- set up bootstrap
- react fragments
- use css grid for products display
- add reviews table to schema
- selected category button styled differently

## NOTES

- search query should return products that: have similar name to the query, or are in the same catrgory (ie. is the query is "fruits", return all products from the fruits category)

- browse items: filter by category, price, search by name
- login / create an account
